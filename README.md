## Portfolio optimization

- Agency: fixed amt of money
- Strategy:
    - MACD, RSI, Volume indicators
    - Options data (?)
    - Research paper method (?)

- RSI: for extreme case, when rsi < 30 for several days, dont touch

- Volume: OBV, A/D, 25% rule vs SMA(10) 
- Aim to reach 3 strategy class: MACD, RSI, SMA crossing

- Problem: Sharpe ratio is low; Sharpe ratio in the library is calculated without risk free rate
